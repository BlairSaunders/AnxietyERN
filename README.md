# Assessing and adjusting for publication bias in the relationship between anxiety and the error-related negativity
Data and Syntax for bias-corrected meta-analysis on anxiety and the ERN. 



# Abstract 

Many clinical neuroscience investigations have suggested that trait anxiety is associated with increased neural reactivity to mistakes in the form of an event-related potential called the error-related negativity (ERN). Two recent meta-analyses indicated that the anxiety-ERN association was of a small-to-medium effect size (rs =.-25 and -.28), however, these prior investigations did not quantitatively adjust these effect sizes for publication bias. Here, in an updated meta-analysis (k=58, N=3819), we found support for an uncorrected effect size of r =-.193, and applied a range of methods to test for and correct publication bias (trim-and-fill, PET, PEESE, Petersâ€™ test, three-parameter selection model). The majority of bias-correction methods suggested that the correlation between anxiety and the ERN is non-zero, but smaller than the uncorrected effect size (average adjusted effect size: r =-.118, range: r =.-045 to -.179). Moderation analyses also revealed more robust effects for clinical anxiety and anxious samples characterised by worry, whereas mixed anxiety was not associated with the amplitude of the ERN. Our results suggest that future research exploring the anxiety-ERN relationship would benefit from increased statistical power and the adoption of certain open science practices.
